<p>Clojure.spec allows us to generate test data based on our specifications. But what about generating a clojure.spec program based off of data? With genetic programming, we’ll explore creating clojure.spec creatures that consume data for food.  Then, we’ll breed, mutate, and evolve them until we have a perfect fitting spec for our data. Finally, we'll take a step back and think about how clojure.spec gives us the ability to have our programs describe themselves and what that means to AI and self-repairing code.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the keynote speaker:</b> Carin Meier is a developer at Cognitect.

<p>If you have read Michael Nygard's "Release it!" you know that a downstream service going down is just one of the many modes of failure that your new service will need to handle in production, and it is not even the worse one.</p><p>To make your system resilient, you also have to worry about networks going slow, disks getting full or third party services disappearing.</p><p>But how can we test those scenarios and make them part of our build pipeline?</p><p>During the presentation you will learn how to create a Clojure test suite that will use Docker to automate your resilience testing.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Daniel Lebrero works as a technical architect at IG on the Big Data team. With more than 15 years of Java experience and 4 of Clojure, he is now a big advocate of the functional approach.</p></div>

<h3><a name="ddjuric">Clojure is not afraid of the GPU</a></h3>
<p>Today's hot topics, data science and machine learning, offer many algorithms that can turn lifeless data into useful information. Based on math-heavy theory, relying on number crunching, often billions and billions of raw operations must be performed quickly. Clojure can be teamed up with hardware accelerators or GPUs to offer both a cozy dynamic REPL environment and the speed and power of low-level hardware optimizations for numerical computations. In this talk, I present a few libraries tailored by the Clojure's measure, that can help achieve state-of-the-art performance: ClojureCL to direct the GPU, Neanderthal to help with vectorization and linear algebra, and Bayadera's incredibly fast MCMC engine. Clojure may not be able to compete with R and Python in the off-the-shelf machine learning, but for high-performance customized algorithms - it can be THE secret sauce.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Dragan Djuric is an associate professor at the Department of  Software Engineering, FON, University of Belgrade, Serbia. He passionately uses Clojure as a primary language since 2009, and teaches Clojure-based courses at the university since 2010.  He published his Clojure-based research in leading scientific journals, but does not skip contributiong to the community through open-source Clojure projects (www.uncomplicate.org).  His main interests are in the area of software engineering and intelligent systems, but programming in Clojure is the activity he enjoys the most. When he is not working in Emacs, he likes doing his daily dose of long-distance running, gym, and Cuban salsa dancing. He also has a black belt in Taekwondo, but is a very calm and friendly person :)</p></div>

<p>Machine learning has become an incredibly popular field of research in the last few years. While there's no shortage of libraries and tutorials in languages like Python and Java, there's relatively little in the world of Clojure. In this talk, we'll dive into machine learning with Clojure and Apache Spark! We'll start out comparing the Flambo and Sparkling libraries by building a binary classifier, then move on to exploring image recognition with a convolutional neural network developed with DeepLearning4J. You'll come away with a solid grasp of introductory theory as well as practical approaches to developing models and neural networks in Clojure.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Eric Weinstein is a senior software engineering lead at Hulu, where he works on internal tools, as well as a masters student at Georgia Tech, where he studies machine learning. He enjoys writing Clojure, Elixir, Idris, Ruby, and Swift.</p></div>

<p>Have you heard about the lambda-calculus, dependent types, intuitionistic v.s. classical logic, or the Curry-Howard correspondence?</p><p>During this talk you will learn much about these, but not presented in the usual academic way... No! Clojure and Emacs/Cider will serve as learning vehicles, throughout a gently-paced live-coding Mathematics session !</p><p>For this we will use LaTTe, an open source proof assistant library for Clojure, probably one of the most addictive single-player puzzle game ever!</p><p>NB: no greek letters were harmed during the preparation of this talk.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Frederic is a professor and researcher at the UPMC University in Paris. Instead of making his students program for him, he program for his students, who can then (surprisingly) focus on the core science. </p><p>He speaks a few extinguished or not so extinguished Lisp dialects (he considers most programming languages as Lisp dialects).</p><p>And his favorite number is 42.</p></div>

<h3><a name="djanus">A case study of natural language processing in Clojure</a></h3>
<p>While Clojure is not a very popular choice for a language in which to implement natural language processing (NLP) tools, in this talk I'll show that it’s not only a feasible choice, but also a practical and pragmatic one.</p> 
<p>I'll present two Clojure-based utilities, Smyrna and Skyscraper, that together allow to convert a series of texts in a morphologically rich language (Polish) to an easily and efficiently searchable corpus and to perform statistical analyses on this corpus. I'll also demonstrate a fairly large (>100M words) corpus built with these tools, the Polish Parliamentary Proceedings Processor (P4). I'll describe each of the tools in turn, how they fit together, and how Clojure allows for having the code concise and expressive while remaining performant.</p> 
<p>I'll put the talk in context by comparing Skyscraper and Smyrna to other similar tools, and also look briefly at Smyrna’s ClojureScript and re-frame-based UI.</p>
<div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Daniel has been working with Clojure since its early days (around 2009). His interests in linguistics and NLP date back even further: he was a core team member of the IPI PAN Corpus of Polish (2004) and developed one of the supplementary tools for National Corpus of Polish (2007). He writes Ruby for a living, and hacks on Clojure in his spare time. When not coding, he can be found playing Scrabble, cycling or petting cats.</p></div>

<p>Clojure provides powerful abstractions and dynamic typing, and its high performance is enabled only through the amazing optimizations provided by the powerful JITs in JVM, V8 et al.</p><p>Using Clojure's new spec and gen features, it's possible to generate specialized versions of Clojure code for constrained specifications, eliminating much of the boilerplate and branch heavy code, which can then be translated into efficient C.</p><p>This talk follows optimization of the humble (fn fib &#91;n]) in its most naive form, using a series of generally applicable techniques to transform it from a O( 2<sup>n</sup> ) to a O( log n ) algorithm, generating efficient C that would be difficult to match by hand.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> I dropped out of uni and started an indie games company, which I did for ten years, with my games having over half a billion plays between them.</p><p>For the past few years I've been branching out into more serious development; currently I'm doing full stack Clojure development at Bookwell. </p></div>

<h3><a name="mmarczyk">Priority Search Queues: 1.5-dimensional tree search</a></h3>
<p>Priority Search Queues are an interesting abstract data type that simultaneously supports sorted map and priority queue operations in such a way that an entry's position in the map's sort order depends on its key, but its priority, as used by the priority queue operations, depends on its value. Additionally, these aspects of PSQs mesh together, so that one can iterate over precisely those entries whose keys fall in between a certain pair of keys and whose values are less than some particular value, in effect performing a 1.5-dimensional search of the PSQ.</p><p>PSQs have been given a particularly elegant presentation and implementation - in Haskell - by Ralf Hinze in his 2001 paper "A Simple Implementation Technique for Priority Search Queues". This talk aims to examine the main ideas behind Hinze's concrete realization of PSQs, to briefly compare it to Edward M. McCreight's original PSQ implementation from the "Priority Search Trees" paper of 1985, and finally to place PSQs in a Clojure context.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Long-time contributor to all parts of ClojureScript, including the compiler and the core library; most notably, author of the ClojureScript ports of the persistent map and set types and PDS-related functionality such as transients.
